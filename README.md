## 📝 About

This is a beginner-friendly blog app project built with React.  
It was created as part of my learning journey to better understand:

- React Router for dynamic routes
- useState for local state management
- Handling user input through forms
- Rendering content conditionally

The app displays a list of blog posts, allows navigating to a detailed view of each post, and supports adding comments.
